Audio hosting where you can listen, create and discuss podcasts.
No advertising, user agreements and data collection - as the Internet should be.

## üí° Main idea

Until now, the concept of "audio hosting" had no clear embodiment and was scattered between essentially similar platforms.
There was no audio service as original as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)**, which implements viewing of videos, **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com)** for creating collages or **[Telegram](https://telegram.org)** for free communication.
Podcasts and voice recordings did not have the right to independence and existed secondary without proper development.

In addition, existing music services such as **[Yandex.Music](https://music.yandex.ru)** or **[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com)**, despite their lack of alternatives, spoil the experience by forcing users to pay for subscriptions and also invading their private digital space (for example, cryptographically prohibiting access to audio files downloaded to the device, depriving a person of trust in their own software).

**SuperCast** is an audio platform with an emphasis on software freedom and user freedom of action.
Here, podcasts and voice recordings, publication attachments and any content can be downloaded, reused and distributed without restrictions - and there is no censorship.
No one limits your external actions and does not intrude into your personal ones - these are the principles of the service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Service mechanics

### Publications

* *Publication* (or post) is the basic unit of content created by the Author.
  Posts are placed in the user profile and can contain text, attachments and audio media (podcast/audio recording).
  Any publication can be rated, as well as commented on with text or voice, or responded to publicly in your profile.

### Podcasts and audio recordings

* *Podcasts* are a key audiovisual format.
  They can be listened to and simultaneously watched as a live transcript of the conversation.
  The player has several types of visual display, and during playback, *Live hints* assigned to specific time codes pop up as notes and attachments.
  Podcasts can be downloaded and listened to in the background.
  You can create a podcast in any application of the service manually through the built-in editor or by importing a ready-made preset.

* *Audio recording* - a short voice message for attachment to a comment or publication, which cannot be pre-recorded.
  Any audio recording can be transcribed into text.
  One audio recording can also be pinned to the profile as a *Voice status*.

### Search engine

* It may seem like a simple feature, but we've built filtered search literally everywhere - it's available on any screen and helps you search for users, posts, comments, or interesting moments in audio media.

### Thematic feeds and subscriptions

* For clarity, the Author can thematically distribute publications in his profile across different *Publication Feeds*, giving them a name and description.
  The listener, in turn, can subscribe separately to each of the feeds (or to the entire Author at once), while the number of the Author's subscribers is made up of the number of users subscribed to at least one of his feeds.

* The listener can combine multiple subscriptions into separate *View Feeds*, separately setting up content display parameters for each.
  View Feeds are available from the main screen and help you better navigate your subscriptions.

### Storage and downloading

* Any content can be marked and added to *Saved*, or downloaded.
  Such content is placed in the Storage, where the listening history is also saved.

* *Storage* is a tree of folders and files of downloads on the current device and virtually saved content, available between several devices.
  Saved content can be grouped at your discretion, and the system will automatically divide it by type.

## üóΩ Features

We do not force users to watch or listen to ads, buy paid subscriptions, and do not impose any age restrictions.
Our work does not include cooperation with governments of countries, and we do not moderate users in political or religious views.
The only moderation of the service is for universally accepted things.

## ü™á Distribution and use

The network is free and will be available in all regions.
We will add a charity subscription that does not bring additional functions, but keeps the service afloat.

The service is under development - an application for **Android** is being prepared.
Later, a **website**, an application for **iOS** and desktop applications for **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS** will be released.

The project has an open code base, but currently does not allow for third-party edits.

## üí¨ And more

Experience with **[Facebook](https://facebook.com)**, **[VK](https://vk.com)**, **[Twitter](https://x.com)** and other revolutionary "junk" shows that social networks take on too much responsibility for people's lives and experiences.
Almost all of them sooner or later get bogged down in money, politics and deception - we do not want the same thing to happen to our service.
We want to believe in the success of **SuperCast**, but we understand the frailty of the project, like any other.
It is unusual to hear something like this from the creators of another social network - isn't it?

Therefore, we challenge all other services, defending the ideology of user freedom, and want to set an example that a free Internet is something to strive for.
We want this example to lead to what we really want, or at least clarify the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat we really need.
We want the end to be what it should be.
