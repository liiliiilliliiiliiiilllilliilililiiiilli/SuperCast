Audio hosting where you can listen, create and discuss podcasts.
No advertising, user agreements and data collection - this is how the Internet should be.

## üí° Main idea

Until now, the concept of "audiohosting" has not had a clear embodiment and was only partially implemented in different, but essentially similar platforms.
There was no audio service as original as **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)** does, offering videos, **[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com)** for creating collages or **[Telegram](https://telegram.org)** for free communication.
Podcasts and voice recordings did not have the right to independence and existed secondary and without due development.

In addition, existing music services such as **[Yandex.Music](https://music.yandex.ru)** or **[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com)**, despite their lack of alternatives, spoil the experience by forcing users to pay for subscriptions, as well as invading their private digital space (for example, cryptographically prohibiting access to audio files downloaded to the device, depriving a person of trust in their own software).

**SuperCast** is an audio platform with an emphasis on software freedom and user freedom of action.
Here, podcasts and voice recordings, publication attachments and any content can be downloaded, reused and distributed without restrictions - and there is no censorship.
No one limits you in external actions and does not intrude into personal ones - these are the principles of the service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Platform mechanics

### Publications

* A *publication* (or post) is the main unit of content created by the Author.
  Posts are placed in the user profile and can contain text, attachments and audio media (podcast or voice recording).
  Posts can be rated, publicly responded to or commented on using text or voice.

### Podcasts and voice recordings

* *Podcasts* are a key audiovisual format.
  You can listen to them and simultaneously watch a live transcript of the conversation.
  The player has several types of visual display, and during playback, *Live Tips* assigned to specific time codes appear as notes and attachments.
  Podcasts can be downloaded and listened to in the background.
  You can create a podcast in any application of the service manually through the built-in editor or by importing an existing project.

* A *Voice* is a short audio message attached to a comment or publication that cannot be pre-recorded.
  Any voice recording can be automatically converted to text.
  You can also pin one post as an *audio status* in your profile header - this way you can talk about your interests, what your blog is about, or just about an update.

### Search engine

* It may seem like a simple function, but we have built in a search with filters literally everywhere - it is available on any screen and helps you quickly search for users, publications, comments, or interesting moments in audio media.

### –¢–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ª–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏

* For clarity, the Author can thematically distribute publications in their profile into different *Feeds* - publications with their own title and description.
  The Listener, in turn, can subscribe separately to each of the feeds (or to the entire Author at once), while the number of the Author's subscribers is made up of the number of users subscribed to at least one of their feeds.

* The Listener can combine multiple subscriptions into a group, creating *View Feeds*, and configure content display parameters for it.
  View Feeds are available from the main screen and help you better navigate your subscriptions.

### Storage and download

* Any content can be marked and added to *Saved*, or downloaded.
  Such content is placed in the Storage, where the listening history is also located.

* The *Storage* is a tree of folders and files of downloads on the current device and virtually saved content, available between several devices.
  You can group saved content at your discretion, and the system will automatically divide it by type.

## üóΩ Features

We do not force users to watch or listen to ads, buy paid subscriptions, and do not impose strict age restrictions.
Our work does not include cooperation with government agencies, and therefore we do not moderate users in political or religious views.
The only moderation of the service is for universally accepted things.

## ü™á Distribution and use

The service is under development - an application for **Android** is currently being prepared.
Later, a **website**, an application for **iOS** and desktop applications for **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS** will be released.
The project has an open code base, but does not yet imply third-party edits.

The network is free and will be available in all regions.
We will add a charitable subscription that does not bring additional functions, but keeps the service afloat.

## üí¨ And also

The experience with **[Facebook](https://facebook.com)**, **[VK](https://vk.com)**, **[Twitter](https://x.com)** and other revolutionary "bullshit" shows that social networks take on too much responsibility for people's lives and experiences.
Almost all of them sooner or later get bogged down in money, politics and deception - we do not want the same to happen to our platform.
We believe in **SuperCast**, but we understand the frailty of the project, like any other.

That is why we challenge all other services, defending the ideology of user freedom and software freedom, and want to set an example that a free Internet is something to strive for.
We want this example to lead to what we really want, or at least clarify the idea of what we really need.
